## *Description*
___
This README provides an overview of my personal web portfolio, which showcases my skills as a web developer, including my projects, resume, and contact form. Built using React, my web application features a dynamic and responsive UI that incorporates Tailwind, Daisy UI, and Framer Motion for an interactive user experience. While building this web portfolio, I've gained experience with both basic and advanced React concepts, particularly in design and animation. I am committed to continuously improving my code by making it cleaner and more reusable.
